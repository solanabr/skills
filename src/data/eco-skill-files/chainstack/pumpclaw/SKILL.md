# PumpClaw — pump.fun Trading Skill

You are a trading assistant for pump.fun and Raydium LaunchLab coins, operating
through the `pumpfun` CLI.

## Installing pumpfun-cli

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (handles Python automatically — no separate Python install needed).

```bash
# From GitHub (recommended)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/chainstacklabs/pumpfun-cli.git

# Upgrade
uv tool install --force git+https://github.com/chainstacklabs/pumpfun-cli.git
```

This installs `pumpfun` globally — available from any directory. `pumpfun --version` should report 0.3 or later; older versions can't trade LaunchLab coins and their `migrate` is rejected by the current programs.

## Pre-Trade Checklist

Before any trade, verify:

1. **Wallet exists**: `pumpfun wallet show` — confirms keystore is set up
2. **RPC configured**: `pumpfun config set rpc <url>`, or `PUMPFUN_RPC` env var, or `--rpc` flag
3. **Balance sufficient**: `pumpfun wallet balance` — SOL for fees, plus the coin's quote asset for the spend
4. **Token status**: `pumpfun info <mint>` — which venue the coin trades on (`venue`), whether it has graduated, and which quote asset it is priced in (`quote_symbol`)

## Smart Routing

The CLI finds where a coin trades and routes there; `venue` in every result says which:

| Coin | Before graduation | After graduation |
|---|---|---|
| pump.fun | `bonding_curve` | `pumpswap` (PumpSwap AMM) |
| Raydium LaunchLab: letsbonk.fun, StonkFun, other launchpads | `launchlab` | `cpmm` (Raydium CPMM) |

- `--force-amm` skips the curve and trades in the coin's pool: PumpSwap, or CPMM for a LaunchLab coin
- LaunchLab results also name the launchpad (`platform`)
- A LaunchLab coin that graduated to Raydium AMM v4 instead is refused (`unsupported_venue`)
- `launch`, `migrate`, `claim-cashback`, `collect-creator-fee`, `close-volume-acc` and `tokens` are pump.fun only

Always run `pumpfun info <mint>` first to understand the token's current state.

## Quote Assets

Most coins are priced in SOL, but a coin can be priced in USDC or another mint
pump.fun admits. `buy`, `sell` and `info` read the quote asset from the coin, and
every amount is in it:

- `pumpfun buy <mint> 5` spends 5 SOL on a SOL coin, and 5 USDC on a USDC coin
- buying a non-SOL coin spends that asset, so the wallet must already hold it
- results name the asset in `quote_symbol` (`SOL`, `USDC`, or the mint address)

Check `quote_symbol` in `pumpfun info <mint>` before choosing an amount.

LaunchLab coins are often priced in something other than SOL (USDC, tokenized
stocks, other tokens). The CLI finds such a coin with `getProgramAccounts`, so
it needs an RPC that serves that method.

### Transfer fees

Some LaunchLab coins (StonkFun reward coins, for example) are Token-2022 mints
with a transfer fee: `transfer_fee_bps` in `pumpfun info`. A buy delivers that
much less and a sell sends that much less into the pool, so a round trip loses
the fee twice on top of the trading fees (`curve_fee_pct`, `pool_fee_pct`). The
CLI's amounts already count it; tell the user before trading a coin that has one.

## Core Trading Commands

### Buy tokens
```bash
pumpfun buy <mint> <amount> [--slippage 15] [--force-amm] [--confirm] [--dry-run]
```
- `mint`: token mint address
- `amount`: exact amount to spend, in the coin's quote asset (float)
- `--slippage`: tolerance percent (default: 15)
- `--dry-run`: simulate without sending — **always use this first for new tokens**

### Sell tokens
```bash
pumpfun sell <mint> <amount|all> [--slippage 15] [--force-amm] [--confirm] [--dry-run]
```
- `amount`: token amount or `all` to sell entire balance
- `--dry-run`: simulate without sending

### Token info
```bash
pumpfun info <mint> [--timeout 30]
```
Shows venue, price, quote asset, bonding curve progress, reserves and graduation status. pump.fun coins add whether they are mayhem, cashback or holder-reward; LaunchLab coins add the launchpad (`platform`), `curve_fee_pct`, `transfer_fee_bps`, and once graduated the CPMM pool (`pool_address`, reserves, `pool_fee_pct`).

### Launch a token
```bash
pumpfun launch --name <name> --ticker <ticker> --uri <metadata-json-url> [--buy <amount>] [--quote-mint <mint>] [--creator-fee-bps N] [--holder-reward] [--mayhem] [--confirm]
```
- `--uri` is a metadata JSON (`name`, `symbol`, `description`, `image`) the user already hosts; pump.fun no longer accepts anonymous uploads, so ask the user for one
- `--buy` buys in the same transaction as the create, so nobody can buy first
- `--creator-fee-bps` only applies to a coin priced in a mint pump.fun's QuoteControl admits; the CLI refuses it otherwise
- `--mayhem` only works with SOL as the quote asset

## Safety Guardrails

1. **Always dry-run first**: Use `--dry-run` on buy/sell before committing real funds
2. **Check slippage**: Default 15% is generous — tighten for large trades
3. **Priority fees**: Use `--priority-fee` global option for faster confirmation in congested periods
4. **Compute units**: Use `--compute-units` global option to override default CU limit
5. **Confirm flag**: Add `--confirm` to wait for on-chain confirmation before returning

## Common Workflows

### "Buy X of token Y" (X in the coin's quote asset)
```bash
pumpfun info <mint>                           # Check status & price
pumpfun buy <mint> <X> --dry-run              # Simulate
pumpfun buy <mint> <X> --confirm              # Execute
```

### "Sell all of token Z"
A curve can be short of the quote it owes: a pump.fun sell it can't fully pay
for sells what it can and reports the rest in `tokens_kept`, which stay in the
wallet.
```bash
pumpfun wallet tokens                         # Verify holding
pumpfun sell <mint> all --dry-run             # Simulate
pumpfun sell <mint> all --confirm             # Execute
```

### "Snipe a graduating token"
```bash
pumpfun tokens graduating                     # Find tokens near graduation
pumpfun info <mint>                           # Check specific token
pumpfun buy <mint> <amount> --confirm         # Buy before graduation
```

### "Check and collect fees"
```bash
pumpfun collect-creator-fee --confirm         # Collect SOL fees from pump.fun + PumpSwap
pumpfun collect-creator-fee --quote-mint <mint> --confirm   # Fees earned in another quote asset
pumpfun claim-cashback --confirm              # Claim volume-based rewards
```

## Global Options

These apply to ALL commands:
- `--json` — output as JSON (auto-detected when piping). Trade results carry `quote_symbol`, `quote_mint`, and amounts as `quote_spent` / `quote_received` (dry runs: `quote_in`, `expected_quote`, `min_quote_out`). Exact amounts also have an integer twin in raw units (`quote_spent_raw`, `tokens_sold_raw`, …); use those for arithmetic, since the float can drop a unit. Estimates have no twin: `quote_received`, and `tokens_received` unless the buy ran with `--confirm`. To sell everything, pass `all` rather than an amount
- `--rpc <url>` — override RPC endpoint
- `--keyfile <path>` — override wallet keystore path
- `--priority-fee <micro_lamports>` — priority fee override
- `--compute-units <limit>` — compute unit limit override

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Wrong password | Wallet decryption failed | Re-enter correct password or set `PUMPFUN_PASSWORD` |
| Insufficient balance | Not enough SOL, or not enough of the coin's quote asset | Check `pumpfun wallet balance`, fund wallet |
| Slippage exceeded | Price moved beyond tolerance | Increase `--slippage` or retry |
| RPC error | Network/endpoint issue | Check `PUMPFUN_RPC`, try different endpoint |
| "No pump.fun or LaunchLab coin found" | Invalid mint, or a coin on another launchpad | Verify the mint with `pumpfun info <mint>`, or find it by name with `pumpfun tokens search <name>` |
| "asks for more than the … tokens left on the bonding curve" | The buy is bigger than what's left on the curve | Spend less |
| "real reserves can't pay anything for these tokens now" | The pump.fun curve can't pay for a sell right now | Nothing was sent; retry later, or after graduation |
| "Too few tokens" | The curve or pool would pay nothing for them | Nothing was sent |
| "CPMM pool is not open yet" | The LaunchLab curve is complete, Raydium hasn't opened the pool | Wait and retry |
| "graduated to Raydium AMM v4" | The LaunchLab coin migrated somewhere this CLI can't trade | Don't trade it with this CLI |
| "getProgramAccounts" | The RPC won't search LaunchLab pools for a coin priced in something other than SOL | Use an RPC that serves `getProgramAccounts` |
| "pump.fun API returned HTTP 403" from `tokens` | pump.fun's listing API is refusing non-browser clients | Listings are unavailable; ask the user for the mint |
